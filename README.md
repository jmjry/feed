#Project: Feed 
Feed is a brand new Oxford based fine dining restaurant opening in January 2022. I was approached by the owners of Feed to design a unique website which accurately represents their style, goal and additionally helps Feed win more customers.

##Technologies: For this project I will be using HTML5 & CSS. Eventually we will be looking to implement some additional technologies such as JavaScript to make the website more interactive.
