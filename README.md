# Project: FEED 
FEED is a brand new Oxford based fine dining restaurant opening in January 2022. I was approached by the owners of FEED to design a unique website which accurately represents their style, goal and additionally helps FEED win more customers.

## Planning process:

* [Initial draft visual representation](https://www.figma.com/file/O8Hf0NU6RWhKRUpCXL9qY4/Wireframing-in-Figma?node-id=109%3A276)
* [Mobile Wireframes](https://github.com/jmjry/feed/files/6925747/Mobile.Wireframes.PDF.pdf)
* [Desktop Wireframes](https://github.com/jmjry/feed/files/6933275/FEED.-.Wireframe.Desktop.pdf)


### Changes to my planning process: 

#### Mobile Wireframes
* Removed icon logo and used text logo in final design
* Position of opening times only changed after tablet design (onto smaller screens)
* Booking form was centered and two additions were made (radio button for booking time & submit button)

#### Desktop Wireframes
* Removed icon logo and used text logo in final design
* Booking form was centered and two additions were made (radio button for booking time & submit button)


## Technologies: 
For this project I will be using HTML5 & CSS. Eventually we will be looking to implement some additional technologies such as JavaScript to make the website more interactive.

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs: 
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) was used to add icons for UX purposes.
* [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/) was the version control used.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) is the repository used for project codes to be pushed from GitPod.
* [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) was used to create wireframes during the design process of this project.

## Features 

### Current features:

* F1 Navigation Bar 
  * The navigation bar used styles consistent with the website. It offers easy navigation through all of the websites pages with a Logo located in the top left of the screen (which can be clicked to take a user straight to the home page) and three headers in the top right: Home, Menu & Bookings. On smaller screen sizes, the font-size will shrink of each of these elements and eventually will reposition so that the Logo sits above the main Navigation bar.

* F2 Hero Image
  * Immediately visible is the hero image, introduction text and action button. After loading the page, a small animation occurs giving a small zoom into the hero image. This was designed to draw attention to the image (the restaurant) and it's call to action - viewing the menu.
  * Overlay introduction text is used to announce the opening of the restaurant in January 2022.
  * Menu button is added to make the experience for a user easier by providing quick access to viewing the menu.

* F3 Example Dishes
  * This section provides images and titles relating to some dishes from the menu. A user gets the opportunity to view a dish before looking further into the website.

* F4 Opening Times 
  * On all pages the Opening Times are displayed so that users may see when the restaurant is open. The design of this changes if the screen size is made smaller, it will reposition the text and headers to fit the page.

![Opening Times](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86608354/128355525-371b06ec-751a-4d8f-bbc0-e5c6349abc5d.png)

* F5 Social Media 
  * Each of the social media buttons will open a new tab and take the user to our associated social media page.

* F6 Address  
  * Our address and phone number is available for users to view and use when planning a visit to the restaurant.

![Address](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86608354/128214817-5f5a843b-f55e-4868-8264-228082a1dc83.png)

* F7 Menu 
  * Currently four menus are available on our website: Starters, Mains, Desserts and Hot Drinks. Each menu has a list of items avaialble, including a short description and the price associated with that item.
  * Eventually we will look to implement other menus such as: Childrens, Sunday Lunch and Allergies.

* F8 Booking Form  
  * Users can fill in the booking form to reserve a table at FEED. It is required that a user provides a name, phone number, booking size and booking time. Users can only enter a number into the phone number and booking size fields.

### Features which could be implemented in the future:

* F9 Company Story 
  * A page or section which explains how the company was founded, including who by, why it was founded and the company goals.

* F10 Navigation bar improvements 
  * To improve design a hamburger menu could be implemented as this would save space on some smaller screens.

## Testing 

Content regarding testing processes undertaken eg: How each feature works as planned, how the site looks on different devices, bugs found & how they were overcome. If section is too long create seperate document with link provided.

### Responsiveness Testing 

* All responsiveness testing was done in the Google Chrome devtool. As I designed my website for desktop, I used media queries across the site to ensure that the website remained responsive at widths all the way down to 320px. 
* After my testing I decided that in the future I will initially design for mobile and then work the responsiveness up.

### Validator testing 

* HTML 
  * No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)

 ### Known Bugs 
 
 * There are currently no known bugs on the website.
 
 ## Deployment 

### How was this site deployed? 

* Firstly, I opened up Feed in the GitHub repository and navigated to the Settings tab. After selecting Settings, I proceeded to click on Pages.
* Following this, I selected Master Branch from the source section.
* After selecting Master Branch, the page will now automatically refresh to display a succesful deployment. 
* Any future changes pushed to the same Master Branch will now take effect on the live page (after a few minutes).

 ## Credits:
 
 * To ensure my CSS code was formatted correctly, I ran it through a formatter which can be found here: [CSS Code Formatter](https://www.freeformatter.com/css-beautifier.html#ad-output)

### Content 

* All written content, including the Menu, is original content written by the developer. 
* All media included on the website is original content given to the developer with permission to use for this project.

### Code 

* As a go to reasource hub I used [W3S Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp).
* To create my responsive picture examples I used [ami.responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is).
* When stuck on a development issue, I checked [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) to see if other developers had the same problems.
* Information, code and tutorials for building my menu came from [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJjej5udWVE) [another developer](https://codepen.io/slstudios/pen/MbjRgg) and [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_web_tmp_pizza.asp). Using techniques from all three of these I created my menu page.


### Media 

* Fonts were imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
* Icons in the Opening Times were imported from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com)
* All images are unique and was provided to me by Lewis Ryan who is the owner of all these images. Lewis has given me full rights to use these images in this project.
