# Project: Feed 
Feed is a brand new Oxford based fine dining restaurant opening in January 2022. I was approached by the owners of Feed to design a unique website which accurately represents their style, goal and additionally helps Feed win more customers.

## Features 

### Content regarding features 

## Technologies: 
For this project I will be using HTML5 & CSS. Eventually we will be looking to implement some additional technologies such as JavaScript to make the website more interactive.

#### Current features:

* F1 Navigation Bar 
  * The navigation bar used styles consistent with the website. It offers easy navigation through all of the websites pages with a Logo located in the top left of the screen (which can be clicked to take a user straight to the home page) and three headers in the top right: Home, Menu & Bookings. On smaller screen sizes, the font-size will shrink of each of these elements and eventually will reposition so that the Logo sits above the main Navigation bar.

### Features which could be implemented in the future:

  * To improve design a hamburger menu could be implemented as this would save space on some smaller screens.

 ## Deployment 

### How was this site deployed? 

* Firstly, I opened up Feed in the GitHub repository and navigated to the Settings tab. After selecting Settings, I proceeded to click on Pages.
* Following this, I selected Master Branch from the source section.
* After selecting Master Branch, the page will now automatically refresh to display a succesful deployment. 
* Any future changes pushed to the same Master Branch will now take effect on the live page (after a few minutes).
