 ## Deployment 

### How was this site deployed? 

* Firstly, I opened up Feed in the GitHub repository and navigated to the Settings tab. After selecting Settings, I proceeded to click on Pages.
* Following this, I selected Master Branch from the source section.
* After selecting Master Branch, the page will now automatically refresh to display a succesful deployment. 
* Any future changes pushed to the same Master Branch will now take effect on the live page (after a few minutes).
